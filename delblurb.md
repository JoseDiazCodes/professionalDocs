# Jose Diaz - Software Engineering: From Experience to Code

Growing up in Boston, I learned firsthand the importance of adaptability and grit. My time on a challenging 72-hour survival trip in Minnesota taught me to think on my feet and approach problems head-on, a mindset I later brought to community projects like helping to build a school in Costa Rica.

Being a personal trainer taught me to tune into people's individual needs and find ways to motivate them. As a preschool teacher, I learned the art of patience and clear communication, even when things get tough. These real-world experiences gave me a unique perspective that I believe is invaluable in the tech scene.

Now, as I move into software engineering, I see it as the next logical step, not a total shift. I'm passionate about coding with understanding and inclusivity, pulling from my past to shape the future. I’m excited to contribute to a tech world that’s as varied and understanding as the experiences that have shaped me.
